# Reference Code and Mockups

This folder contains reference code and mockups. It is not intended for upload onto a production  website. It won't hurt anything, but visitors may get confused if they stumble upon the mockups.

## Mockups & the Design Process

Mockups are for visualizing what the finished theme would look like and do not contain any functionality on their own.

Since Hubzilla .tpl (template) files contain a lot of functionality, creating a new theme requires more than just pasting  HTML and CSS into a template file.

For creating a theme from scratch, we will typically follow these steps:

1. Create a mockup to test the design. 
2. Chop the HTML into pieces and place them in the appropriate .tpl files.
3. Add the code for Hubzilla functionality.

If we are just creating a variation of an existing theme, it is even simpler:

1. Create a derivative theme.
2. Change only the parts that have changed. It will override the base theme.

## Reference Code

If we are basing a new Hubzilla theme off of another free theme, sometimes it is useful to reference the original theme, so we don't have to hunt for it somewhere else.  The reference code will obviously not work in Hubzilla as is, and is simply included to make it easier to port a theme from another system to Hubzilla.

For example, we might include a free MIT licensed HTML5 theme here, and then port that to Hubzilla.

Note: Only MIT Licensed code can be included in this repository. So only free themes that are MIT licensed would be included in this repository as a reference.

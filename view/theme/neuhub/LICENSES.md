# Aggregate Works

The MIT license allows you to use all or part of this software in other works, however, you must comply with the terms of the MIT License in all cases. 

Depending on how Neuhub is distributed or conveyed, it may be considered part of an aggregate, since it is an independent addon and theme that works with multiple scripts.

- AGPL: Inclusion of an AGPL covered work in an aggregate does not cause the AFPL License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.
- GPL: Inclusion of a GPL covered work in an aggregate does not cause this GPL License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.

The aggregate provisions of these licenses do not apply if you intergrate our code with another software in such a way where it is no longer an independent addon or theme. If that is the case, the user can always go to the original MIT licensed repositories to get the MIT licensed version of the code. 

Note: You can sublicense MIT licensed code, but you cannot relicense it under a different license since you are not the copyright holder and license grantor.
